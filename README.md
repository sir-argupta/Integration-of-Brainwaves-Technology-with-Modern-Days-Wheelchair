# Integration-of-Brainwaves-Technology-with-Modern-Days-Wheelchair
As this aims to build device, basically a smart wheelchair based on Micro-controller &amp; Neuro-Control. 

This project is aimed towards quadriplegics, paraplegics, people involved in freak accidents that have left them without an extremity or any for that matter and people with motor conditions severe enough to impair movement of the extremities; it will give them an alternative way of controlling traditional wheelchairs. The completion of this project will benefit the following people/institutions: 
1. Partially or completely disabled people motor-wise; 
2. People with fully-functioning brains whose motor movements are impaired; and, 
3. Medical companies, which will now have an alternative for people with mobility impairments.
